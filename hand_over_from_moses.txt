1. DataGen
	Be familiar with the scripts and files in centralDatagen folder in
	our git repo. Also have a look at this links for 3g session browser 
	data tool:
	https://confluence-oss.lmera.ericsson.se/display/SB/SessionBrowser+Datagen

	In case a reboot was needed:
	a. Run /eniq/home/dcuser/centralDatagen/init_datagen_server.pl
	b. check /tmp/datagen_start_stop.log
	c. If any step failed in the log, please re-do it manually.
	d. check the workflows from desktop viewer. NOTE: if GPEH_SESSION workflow
		is failing, make sure the 3g sess browser datagen tool is running, check the
		exception message, remove the blocking file if necessary and do not 
		restart the workflow manually. It will start after every 15 min.
	
2. Running WCDMA CFA/HFA in eclipse.

	a. Load WCDMA CFA/HFA data. You almost always have to do this
		inorder to clear the tables of 3g Session browser  data.
	b. Make sure selenium.properties file is pointing to correct ENIQ hosts.
	c. Make sure selenium.properties file is pointing to correct selenium server IP and port.
	
3. Running 3G Session browser in eclipse.
	
	a. Load data if server does not have 3g Sess browser data
	b. Run Config_3GSESSBROWSER.txt with all but SB_FIND_IMSI commented out.
	c. Copy IMSI lines in server reservedData.csv to eclipse reservedData.csv. Session browser
		imsi lines begin with SB_IMSI_ in the reservedData.csv. You can find the server file at
		/eniq/home/dcuser/selenium/selenium-grid-1.0.8/test-cases/resources/reservedData.csv
	d. Make sure selenium.properties file is pointing to correct ENIQ hosts
	e. Selenium server not required i.e webdriver based.
	
4. CI Scripts 
	CAR is currently in charge of eniq_jump.pl, eniq_upgrade.pl, eniq_events_rollback.pl 
	and eniq_events_post_install.pl.
	You can access these from clearcase with a dynamic view.
	
	See link below for creating a dynamic view:
	http://atrclin2.athtem.eei.ericsson.se/wiki/index.php/Hub_FAQ_for_Athlone#How_do_I_create_a_ClearCase_dynamic_view
	
	Config spec:
		element * CHECKEDOUT
		element * R6_OSSRC_3PP
		element * .../eniq/LATEST
		element * /main/LATEST
	
	You can open this view in clearcase explorer and see the files in ossrc_del-mgt/bin
	
	Checking out/in the scripts:
	a. You would need to ssh into clearcase master server 150.132.151.70 with your 
		windows username and password.
	b. set view and change folder to CI bin folder:
		emosjil selid1a029> ct setview emosjil_view3
		emosjil_view3 selid1a029> cd /vobs/ossrc/del-mgt/bin/
	c. checkout your script. press CTRL+D when done entering comments.
		emosjil_view3 selid1a029> ct co eniq_upgrade.pl

5. Jenkins jobs for testing CI scripts
	
	The following are jenkins jobs to test CI scripts:
	http://eselivm2v214l.lmera.ericsson.se:8080/jenkins/view/CAR/job/eniq_events_multiblade_initial_install/
	http://eselivm2v214l.lmera.ericsson.se:8080/jenkins/view/CAR/job/eniq_events_multiblade_upgrade/
	http://eselivm2v214l.lmera.ericsson.se:8080/jenkins/view/CAR/job/eniq_events_rollback/
	http://eselivm2v214l.lmera.ericsson.se:8080/jenkins/view/CAR/job/eniq_events_standalone_install/
	http://eselivm2v214l.lmera.ericsson.se:8080/jenkins/view/CAR/job/eniq_events_standalone_upgrade/
	
	Make sure to use your view when testing. That way you can test your
	changes before checking them in.
